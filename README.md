# Solar System WebGL Project

## Overview

This collaborative project, developed for the Graphic Computing subject, aimed to create a realistic Solar System using WebGL. The team, consisting of three colleagues, successfully achieved a perfect score by implementing various features and controls to enhance the user experience.

## Interface

The interface provides a range of options for users to interact with the Solar System model:

- **Shader Selection:** Swap between Shader Phong and Gouraud for different visual effects.
- **Lighting Controls:** Adjust the components of diffuse and ambient light.
- **Specular Light:** Change the amount of specular light for added realism.
- **Planetary Movement:** Toggle translational movement of the planets and asteroids.
- **Model Manipulation:** Various controls for exploring and interacting with the model.

## Solar System Components

The implemented model includes:

- The Sun
- The 8 main planets of the Solar System (Mercury to Neptune)
- Dwarf planet Pluto
- Earth's moon, along with moons of Jupiter and Saturn
- Asteroid belt with 100 asteroids
- Kuiper belt with 200 asteroids
- Skybox for the background

Additionally, the scale and rotation periods of the planets adhere to real values.

## Camera Controls

Users can navigate the Solar System using the following commands:

- **WASD or Arrows:** Move the camera forward, left, backward, and right.
- **Space:** Move the camera upward.
- **Ctrl:** Move the camera downward.
- **Left Shift:** Increase camera speed while pressed.
- **1:** Focus the camera on Earth, toggle off by pressing the key again or moving the camera.
- **2:** Position the camera on the surface of the Sun.
- **Mouse:** Rotate the camera horizontally and vertically in first person.
- **o:** Toggle orbit lines visibility.

## Usage

Open the **index.html** file or just go to ***<https://galaxycrush.github.io/CG-Project/>*** to see a live demo .
**Note**: I recommend using hardware acceleration for a better experience.
